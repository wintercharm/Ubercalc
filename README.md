# Ubercalc

To Run This you need to add it to a Ti84 / 84Plus (or an emulator of one of these), then unarchive it (move to RAM) and run the program. 
Menu system will let you find what you need to do once you're in. 
Make sure the .8xp and .8xo file are in the same folder on your calculator or emulator of a calculator.
Run UberCalc *Not* UCalc -- UberCalc will launch UCalc if necessary, as having them both running at once takes too much memory.
